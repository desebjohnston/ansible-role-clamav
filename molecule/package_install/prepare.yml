# When installing packages during later steps, the Fedora Docker
# images we are using (geerlingguy/docker-fedora34-ansible:latest and
# geerlingguy/docker-fedora35-ansible:latest) can throw sporadic
# errors like:
#
# No such file or directory: '/var/cache/dnf/metadata_lock.pid'
#
# Our fix is to ensure that systemd finishes initializing before
# continuing on to the converge tasks.  For details see:
